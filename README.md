FanController - Ceiling Fan Controller 
=========================================

Summary:
This project contains everything you need in order to control your Ceiling Fans from your smart phone.  We do this by tapping into the orginal RF remote of your fan by using Optocouplers. 

There are 3 key components to this project (1 Custom PCB Board, 2 Spark Core Code, and 3 Android/Android Wear app)

The PCB Board can be manufactured at OSHPark (https://oshpark.com/) for about 15$ with a 1-2 week turn around.  In the 'Docs' folder you will find a BOM that contains everything you need to build the board.

The controller for the circuit board is a Spark Core (http://spark.io).  The code is in 'Spark' folder.
